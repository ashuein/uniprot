UNIPROT.PY
==========

This is my uniprot python library. It provides a bunch of 
routines to access the uniprot.org website's RESTful API.

Principally, you want to do two things:

1. Map different types of sequence identifiers
2. Fetch uniprot metadata for certain sequence id's.

Given a set of seqid's, this library allows a programmic
approach to transforming id's and if the uniprot_id is
obtained, it allows the extraction of the relevant metadata,
including the protein sequence.
